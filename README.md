# Otter-Library
 
My little website which I made to please my growing obsession with otters.
It is a library of otter species, to look them up, gaze at the pictures and find out fun facts!

Published via Github Pages.

I have used Bootstrap and jQuery to help me with the layout and functionality of the website.

The information on the website is from wikipedia, and so are the images. I cannot guarantee the flawlessnes of the information. If you do find something wrong or have feedback, please feel free to contact me via email at "kappelers77@gmail.com"

Thank you and have a great day :)
